# Genius Instant

A Chrome Extension for getting lyrics of music video clips. I built it as I got sick from switching back and forth between Youtube and Genius.

For geek folks on this platform, this is a Yeoman project and the whole work is done in app/ folder:
- manifest.json is a declarative file that chrome needs for your app to fetch resources, etc...
- scripts.babel/ is the main folder where we write javascript ES6 code (then it is translated into ES5 by babel, see the GruntFile.js for that matter)
